1. Different background color for the Form Box (use a color picker to get the code)
2. Different hover border color for the submit button
3. Different font size for everything in the Form Box
4. Challenge: make a background IMAGE for the HTML Body (you'll need to look that up in W3 Schools)
5. Challenge: do something else and we'll see if we can catch it!
